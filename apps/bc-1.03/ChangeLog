Wed Jul 20 22:46:32 1994  Phil Nelson  (phil@cs.wwu.edu)

	* bc.y: change definition of next_label in function definition.
	  Previous value of 0 caused break to not work.  It is now 1.

Fri Apr  8 14:16:37 1994  Phil Nelson  (phil@cs.wwu.edu)

	* Makefile: Change the distribution to include libmath.h.dist
	  which is a copy of libmath.h that has the compiled libmath.b.

Sun Feb 13 01:08:14 1994  Phil Nelson  (phil@cs.wwu.edu)

	  C.  \a => alert (bell) \b => backspace and added \q => ".

Wed Oct 27 23:34:40 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil@cs.wwu.edu)

	* Makefile: Changed compress to gzip.  Changed the
	  comment and definition of the DOT_IS_LAST compile option.

	* scan.l: Changed DOT_IS_LAST to NO_DOT_LAST and changed
	  the test so "." is the last variable is standard.

Wed May 19 15:15:12 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* number.c: Fixed output of negative numbers in bases other than
	  base 10.

Wed Apr 21 11:56:31 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

Wed Apr 14 12:13:39 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

Wed Mar 31 16:12:39 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* bc.1: Updated segment number for function bodies.

Thu Mar 11 15:34:34 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Makefile: added version.h to bc.o's dependency list.

Mon Mar  1 14:00:46 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* util.c: (nextarg) changed parameter "val" to be an int.

Tue Feb 16 10:06:45 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* util.c: (call_str, arg_str) added a function call_str that
	  correctly produces the string of argmuent types for a function
	  call.  arg_str produced them in the reverse order.  This
	  eliminated the need for the "comma" argument to arg_str, which
	  was removed.

	* bc.y: changed the calls to arg_str to have only one parameter
	  in the function definition rule and replaced the call to arg_str
	  with call_str in the function call rule.

Tue Nov 24 17:38:40 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Makefile: Added LEXLIB definitions for use with lex.

Thu Oct 22 13:43:16 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	  the computation by not doing unneeded multiplications.

Wed Sep 30 10:43:52 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Makefile: Made changes to make it more in conformance with the
	  GNU coding standards.

Tue Jul  7 21:09:07 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (const.h, bc.y, util.c) Added code so that when the math
	  library is loaded, redefinition of any math library function
	  will not cause the other functions to quit working correctly.
	  Before this change, redefining a(x) would cause s(x) and c(x)
	  to quit working and redefining s(x) would cause c(x) to quit
	  working.

Wed Jul  1 14:35:29 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (libmath.b) Changed the calculation of scale for computing
	  e(x) and l(x).  This provides a little more accuracy in the
	  last digit at the expense of a little speed.

	* (Test/checklib.b) Changed tests to be parameterized and test
	  more values.

Thu Jun 25 09:22:59 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (configure) changed the script from looking in the
	  include directory for a .h file to asking cc (gcc) to
	  find the .h file.  This will allow better detection
	  of include files available to the C compiler.

Wed Jun 24 22:11:37 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (bc.y) Added a warning for the "last" variable.

	* (scan.l) Added code to allow for a single dot (.) to be the
	  same as the variable "last".  This is not a "standard" feature,
	  but is provided for those who want it.

	* (Install) Documented the new define for dot (.).

	* (bc.1) Documented the use of dot (.) for "last".

	* (Makefile) Added an easy method for adding extra defines for
	  use during the compile.  Set DOT_IS_LAST as a standard
	  extra define.

	* (number.c) Changed the code for sqrt for better speed.

Mon Jun 22 21:47:05 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Changed the name of math.h to libmath.h to avoid conflict
	  with /usr/include/math.h.  Changed all references to math.h
	  to libmath.h in all files.

	* (configure) Changed the test for long strings accepted by
	  cc to not include libmath.h and thus not need to distribute
	  a file that is generated by the system.

	* (Makefile) Changed PREFIX, BINDIR, LIBDIR, and MANDIR to
	  lower case.

Tue Mar  3 10:16:07 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (main.c) Added missing } at line 140.

	* (bc.1) Added a new "VERSION" section.

Wed Jan 29 14:13:55 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (execute.c) Removed the setjmp and longjmp calls that may have
	  caused some problems with interrupted programs.

Thu Jan 16 17:08:16 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (Makefile) Changed install to install the manual.

Wed Jan  8 13:23:42 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Change all copyright notices to include 1992.
	
	* (load.c) Added termination to "load_code" to ignore code
	  after an error has been found.

	* (scan.l) Changed the check for NUL characters in STRING tokens
	  (before the close quote) to work correctly.  Also added code to
	  report illegal characters in a more readable output format.

	* (bc.1) Added the exclusion of NUL characters from strings in
	  the "differences" section and updated date of last change.

	* (const.h) Changed BC_MAX_SEGS to 16.

Mon Jan  6 14:20:02 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (number.c) Changed the out_num routine to use a correct field
	  size for bases greater than 16.  e.g.  For base 1000, each
	  "digit" is a three digit number.

	* (Makefile) Added the "8" flag to get an 8 bit scanner.

	* (scan.l) Changed "char *" to "unsigned char *" to match the
	  declaration of yytext for the 8 bit scanner.  Also added code
	  to detect the null character in strings and generate an error.

Sat Jan  4 20:32:20 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (const.h) Changed BC_BASE_MAX to INT_MAX to allow more bases!

Mon Dec 30 21:47:28 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (main.c) Fixed the bug that loaded the math library before
	  every file.

	* (bc.y) Removed some type declarations that duplicated token
	  definitions so it could be run through bison.

	* (load.c) Added a check for maximum code size.

	* (Makefile) Added a prefix for LIBDIR and BINDIR so it can be
	  changed easily.

Mon Nov 25 13:11:17 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Changed version number in version.h to 1.01 with current date.

	* Changed LIBFILE definition in Makefile.

	* Added a recursive function example to bc.1.

Sun Nov 24 21:24:01 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Changed the Makefile to make sure configure is run first.
	  Added the $(CC) the configure call.  Moved some defines
	  toward the front of the Makefile to make sure they are
	  read by installers.  Also added SUBDIRS variable and updated
	  the GNU distribution to include the subdirectories.  Included
	  math.h in the distribution for use by configure.  Included
	  ChangeLog in the distribution.

	* Split the README into README and Install.  Changed Install
	  to have current information.  Documented the STRINGS_H define.
	  Updated the version number in README.

Fri Nov 22 15:06:32 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Changed configure to check for varargs.h first.  Also, added
	  checks to see if long strings (math.h) are accepted by the
	  C compiler.  Also added parameters to configure.

	* Deleted #include <sys/types.h> from proto.h.  Also made only
	  ANSI C compilers include <stdlib.h>.

	* Changed the Makefile to have the install bin directory be
	  /usr/local/bin and the install lib directory be /usr/local/lib.

	* Changed some files in the Test directory to eliminate the
	  <op>= form that some older bcs don't like.

	* Made some small corrections in bc.1.

Tue Oct 29 10:06:32 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Called current version 1.00.
